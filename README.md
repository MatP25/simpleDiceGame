# simpleDiceGame

A simple dice game made in Javascript as a part of the Interactivity with JavaScript and jQuery course in Coursera. 
The main goal of this course's module was to build the code from scratch given only the rules for the game in order to practice problem solving and problem deconstructing.

1st commit: This is my first iteration of the game prior to any review.
